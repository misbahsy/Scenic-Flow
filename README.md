## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Install the latest version from the [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Package Manager**: Choose one of the following for managing dependencies:
  - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
  - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
  - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
  - [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/misbahsy/txt-to-video
   cd video-editor
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Choose your preferred package manager to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # Using Yarn
   yarn install

   # Using pnpm
   pnpm install

   # Using Bun
   bun install
   ```

## Configuration

### 1. Create a Free Langflow Account

- Visit [Astra Datastax Langflow](https://astra.datastax.com/) to create a free Langflow account.
- Follow the registration process and verify your email if required.

### 2. Obtain Langflow API Token and Base Path

- After logging in, navigate to the Langflow dashboard.
- Generate or retrieve your **API Token**.
- Note down the **Base Path** for the Langflow API.

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:
```env
VITE_ASTRA_LANGFLOW_TOKEN=AstraCS:xxxx
VITE_LANGFLOW_BASE_PATH="/api/langflow/lf/xxxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxx/api/v1/run/flow-id"
```

**Note:** Ensure that VITE_LANGFLOW_BASE_PATH starts with /api/langflow/... which is available from </>API tab at the bottom right of the Langflow UI. Also make sure `.env` is **not** committed to version control to keep your API tokens secure.

### 4. Import Langflow Flow

You can use the predefined flow located at `src/utils/langflow_flow/Slides with images.json`. Simply drag and drop this flow into the Langflow dashboard to get started.

## Running the Development Server

Start the development server using your chosen package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using Yarn
yarn dev

# Using pnpm
pnpm dev

# Using Bun
bun dev
```

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.
- The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, run the following command with your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run build

# Using Yarn
yarn build

# Using pnpm
pnpm build

# Using Bun
bun build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Linting

Ensure code quality and consistency by running the linter:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run lint

# Using Yarn
yarn lint

# Using pnpm
pnpm lint

# Using Bun
bun lint
```

The linter checks for syntax errors and enforces coding standards based on the `.eslintrc.json` configuration.
